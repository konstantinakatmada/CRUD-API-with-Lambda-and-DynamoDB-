# CRUD-API-with-Lambda-and-DynamoDB-
I created a serverless API that creates, reads, updates, and deletes items from a DynamoDB table

Accessing the DynamoDB Table

To access the DynamoDB table that was created for this project, follow the steps below:
Option 1: Using the DynamoDB web service

1.   Sign in to your AWS Management Console.
2.  Navigate to the DynamoDB service.
3.   Select the region where the DynamoDB table is located (e.g., eu-north-1).
4.   In the DynamoDB console, locate the table named http-crud-tutorial-items.
5.   From the table details page, you can view and interact with the table data, perform CRUD operations, and configure table settings.

Option 2: Using DynamoDB Local (downloadable version)

If you prefer to run DynamoDB locally for development and testing purposes, you can follow these steps:

1.  Download and set up DynamoDB Local by following the instructions in the Setting up DynamoDB local (downloadable version) guide.
2. Start the DynamoDB Local server.
    Access the DynamoDB Local web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8000.
    In the web interface, you can create and manage tables, insert data, and perform various DynamoDB operations.
